agnes nutter being burned at the stake and looking rather cheerful about it. \nthe first word she could recognize was nice. very few people at the age of eight and a half know that nice also means \u201cscrupulously exact,\u201d but anathema was one of them. \nthe second word was accurate. \nthe first sentence she had ever read out loud was: \n\u201ci tell ye thif, and i charge ye with my

that there was no mention made of her children, or indeed, any events in her future further away than eleven years\u2019 time. when you\u2019re eight and a half, eleven years is a lifetime, and of
